Learn the basics of Swift programming and how to create a simple iOS app from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Mac computer running macOS 10.15 or later
- Xcode 12 or later installed
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts

## Step 1: Create a New Xcode Project

Open Xcode and create a new project by selecting "App" under "iOS" and clicking "Next". Choose "Swift" as the language and "Storyboard" as the user interface option. Click "Next" and enter a product name for your app, such as "HelloWorld". Choose a location to save your project and click "Create".

## Step 2: Design the User Interface

In the Xcode project navigator, open the Main.storyboard file. This is where you'll design the user interface for your app.

Drag a "Label" object from the Object Library onto the view controller. Resize the label and center it horizontally and vertically on the view.

## Step 3: Connect the Label to Code

To update the text of the label from code, we need to create an outlet connection between the label and the view controller.

Open the Assistant Editor by clicking the "Show Assistant Editor" button in the Xcode toolbar. Make sure "Automatic" is selected under "Preview".

Ctrl-drag from the label to the view controller code to create an outlet. Name the outlet "helloLabel".

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var helloLabel: UILabel!

```

## Step 4: Write the Code

Open the ViewController.swift file and add the following code to the viewDidLoad() method:

```swift

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var helloLabel: UILabel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        helloLabel.text = "Hello, World!"
    }

}

```

## Step 5: Run the App

Click the "Run" button in the Xcode toolbar to run the app. You should see the label change to "Hello, World!".

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a simple iOS app using Swift. You also learned how to design the user interface and connect the user interface elements to code.
