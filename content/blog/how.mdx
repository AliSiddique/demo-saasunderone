Learn how to build a simple blog using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
 
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Next.js

## Step 1: Create a New Next.js App

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog
```

Replace `my-blog` with the name of your app.

## Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS

Next, install Tailwind CSS by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

## Step 4: Add Tailwind CSS to Your App

Open the `styles/globals.css` file and add the following code:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

## Step 5: Run Your App

Start your Next.js app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
